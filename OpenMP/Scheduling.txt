#pragma omp for schedule(guided)
Schedule is a section which specifies the mechanism - static or dynamic (includes guided) 
to share the workload across the threads with loops. 

Chunksize is the number of iterations to allocate per thread.

Static will result in fixed allocation based on number of iterations divided among number of threads.
Dynamic will divide the iterations one by one across the threads.

If every iteration takes different computation time for different logic or indices - Dynamic scheduling is preferred.
If every iteration takes a constant amount of computation time - Use Static scheduling.  

You can allocate chunksize optionally for dynamic scheduling as well to reduce context switching time between each threads.
Chunksize of 1 will result in frequent context switches. A greater chunksize will have a significan delay between context switches.
